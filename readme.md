## Summary
The Species Delimitation plugin for the Geneious bioinformatics software (www.geneious.com) is an exploratory tool that
allows users to assess putative species in phylogenetic trees. The plugin summarises measures of phylogenetic support
and diagnosability of species defined as user-selected collections of taxa, but it does not provide definitive support
for species groups.
